  A simple, fast GUI solution for Pygame. [WORK-IN-PROGRESS] Please do not use yet, big changes are planned, so your code will probably not work in future versions. PygameUILib only has 1 dependency: pygame. Meaning that this library doesn't require any other library to function. This library also includes a CSS interpreter for styling, this interpreter has a big O notation of O(n) meaning that it is very fast and doesn't scale exponentially based on filesize!
